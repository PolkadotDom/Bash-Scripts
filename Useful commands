// Test new fellowship runtime
build node from polkadot-sdk (using correct branch that fellowship runtimes are currently against)
build the chain spec for the wasm you want
run with the custom chain spec using ./$NODE_NAME --chain ./$CHAIN_SPEC_NAME.json --dev

so it turns out you don't actually have to compile the wasm, as that'll be redundant because the chain spec
generator will do it as well. The wasm it uses is built into it's executable

the chain spec generator
cd fellowship-runtimes/chain-spec-generator
cargo run --release --features polkadot -- polkadot-dev > /path/to/your/wanted/dir/polkadot-dev.json
